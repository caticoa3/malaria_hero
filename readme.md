Web application that classifies single cells as parasitized or normal; and prioritizes patients based on the percentage of infected cells. More background can be found in this [medium post](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/https-blog-insightdatascience-com-malaria-hero-a47d3d5fc4bb).

Created thanks to publicly available [data from the NIH](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/).
